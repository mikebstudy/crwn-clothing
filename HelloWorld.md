# HelloWorld

### Intention

- Intended to be a Hello World setup for cloning for a new project or new experimental starting point of this project
- To implement, just starting a new branch: main.HelloWorld
    + Currently, the rename of L065a.HelloWorld
- Will also be an experiment of having a setup branch that is applied to this branch to see the effects and validate the approach and feasibility of establishing parallel subprojects of the original project

### (From original README.md)
L065a.HelloWorld: Clean and setup initial Hello World state
- (MB: Hello World seems like a simple starting state to confirm setup is working) 

### main.HelloWorld

- Rename of L065a.HelloWorld to main.HelloWorld

### Update to use Google fonts

- main.Setup merged into main.HelloWorld
    - changed index.html 
    - added Google fonts
    - other files updated too
- App.css changed to use Google Fonts
- index.html browser tab changed to read 'Crown Clothing - Hello World'
