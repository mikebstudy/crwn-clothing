# SetupLearning

### Intention

- Intended to capture the setup for the project to use as a starting point for another project or experimental copies of this project
- Realized it might be possible by creating a main.setup branch with this in it
    + Still need to prove out the concept
- Also intended for notes on fixup and learning about setup fixups to make things work

### (From Original README.md)

A01.Setup: Run npx create-react-app, then start Readme
- Add repo to GitHub
- Create folder for project ie `crwn-clothing`
- cd into folder
- `git clone <SSH URL> .` (causes clone into current folder)
    + adds git with single `Initial commit` 
        * Apparently using author from github site and name and email
- `npx create-react-app .` (to create in current folder)
    + when done in this sequence, there is no extra git commit created by npx

A01.Setup: Add sass

- `yarn add node-sass`

### main.Setup

- Create and start SetupLearning.md
- Rename A01.Setup to main.Setup
